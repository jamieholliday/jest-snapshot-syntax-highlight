## Features

This extension adds syntax highlighting to Jest snapshots in VSCode. This is currently in an experimental state but seems to work for my use case

## Instalation

* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.

## Attribution

The jest-snapshot.tmLanguage file was originally forked from
https://github.com/yungsters/sublime/blob/master/tmLanguage/JavaScript%20(JSX).tmLanguage

Some pieces have been removed to make it work with snapshot. There are probably a whole bunch of other bits that can be removed
